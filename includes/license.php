<?php
/*
	This file handles the support licensing control for Paid Memberships Pro
	and PMPro addons.

	How it works:
	- All source code and resource files bundled with this plugin are licensed under the GPLv2 license unless otherwise noted (e.g. included third-party libraries).
	- An additional "support license" can be purchased at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/
	  which will simultaneous support the development of this plugin and also give you access to support forums and documentation.
	- Once your license has been purchased, visit Settings --> PMPro License in your WP dashboard to enter your license.
	- Once the license is activated all "nags" will be disabled in the dashboard and member links will be added where appropriate.
    - This plugin will function 100% even if the support license is not installed.
    - If no support license is detected on this site, prompts will show in the admin to encourage you to purchase one.
	- You can override these prompts by setting the PMPRO_LICENSE_NAG constant to false.
*/

/*
	Developers, add this line to your wp-config.php to remove PMPro license nags even if no license has been purchased.

	define('PMPRO_LICENSE_NAG', false);	//consider purchasing a license at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/
